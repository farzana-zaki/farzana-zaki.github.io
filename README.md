# Project-1: Gen-AI-applications-with-Langchain

# Langchain Data Science Assistant (Github link: https://github.com/farzana-zaki/Gen-AI-applications-with-Langchain)

## Business Context
Perhaps the largest and most prominent application of Large Language Models has been their ability to converse with human users in coherent Natural Language and function as helpful assistants for organizational productivity. As we know by now, a lot of work goes into creating and providing such Assistant-style LLMs to us as a service - the hugely compute-expensive Supervised Pre-training stage that's responsible for the vast majority of the LLM's world knowledge, the Instruction-style Supervised Fine-tuning stage on curated dialog datasets that adapts the LLM's behavior to that of a high-quality assistant, and the RLHF stage that teaches the LLM to provide responses that are aligned with human values. The archetypal assistant-style Generative AI solution today is probably an LLM-powered chatbot that can query your databases, analyze our data and even fetch our answers to contextual questions from documents or the web.

In this Final Project, I have applied a Data Analysis / Data Science twist to this functionality. I have used the LangChain framework on top of an LLM to create a Data Science Assistant that will automate the following tasks for us by converting the Natural Language requests we provide into the code required to execute the task:

Data Analysis

Data Science & Machine Learning Modeling

Relational Database Querying

Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Contextual Answers

There are obvious reasons why such a project could be highly significant to business/research. By automating the code tasks common to various operations in Data Analysis, Data Science, or Database Querying, such a solution has the potential to save significant time, improve code accuracy, and also open up Data Analysis and Data Science to a more general audience that may not be familiar with the code involved.

From a broader perspective, the newfound ability of the best large language models (beyond 1 billion parameters) to understand the true meaning of Natural Language commands and coherently respond to, acknowledge, and fulfill them has enabled us to usher in the next wave in the long list of automation that Computer Science has seen in its history. Translating commands into programming code, once solely the province of human developers, is now increasingly being automated by Generative AI, and we'll see many examples of the same in this project.

## Project Objective:

In this project, a LangChain agent has been utilized as a Data Science Assistant and a Data Retriever Assistant, with the capacity to perform a range of tasks, including data analysis, machine learning modeling, relational database querying, and RAG generation for contextual questions from documents or the web. The agent keeps generating commands until it obtains the response the user wants, iterating until it satisfies their question or reaches the set limit.

## Recommendations:

• This project can significantly impact businesses and research sectors, as it automates repetitive tasks and frees up more time for strategic work in the realms of Data Analysis, Data Science, and Database Querying.

• For example, LangChain agents can automatically summarize customer emails, generate reports, generate, or edit codes, or schedule meetings according to user preferences. This type of assistant can save significant time and improve code accuracy without necessitating extensive coding expertise.

• Additionally, it can expand the accessibility of Data Analysis and Data Science to individuals who may not be fully familiar with the involved coding procedures. LangChain agents are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.

• LangChain agents possess the capability to handle dynamic situations and adapt their actions based on new information or user feedback, enhancing the user experience and expediting task completion in a more intuitive, efficient, and collaborative manner.

Through the utilization of language models via LangChain agents, we are on the edge of a new era of automation, efficiency, and collaboration. This technology is a powerful asset that has the potential to revolutionize the standard practices of various industries.
